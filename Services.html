    <h2><p> Many hospitals in Aurangabad city, even the reputed ones, still use handwritten records for
    storing medical data. The storage and handling of the history of records become tedious when the
    stack of records increases.</p>
<p>It becomes significantly more difficult when the patients are being referred from one hospital to
    another. For example, many times, a patient might get referred from Government Hospital to
    Government Cancer hospital, or even vice-versa. The patient now will have to carry all the
    reports with her/him to the other hospital. This also happens between different departments in a
    single hospital. Now, on the other end of the spectrum, if a medical record gets lost or is
    damaged, the patient has no other choice but to get herself/himself re-examined. This results in
    waste of precious resources and money.</p>
<p>Digitizing the records will help people who can't afford to take the medical tests all over again.
    The Government Medical College of Aurangabad faces a different problem. Although, they have
    their own HMIS system, for the year 2018-2019 it had only 52 records in the casualty
    department. The main reason for this is, there is hardly enough time for the medical consultants
    to fill in the hospital records.</p>
<p>The objective of this portal is to provide all medical details related to a person on a single page
    so that it becomes easy and comfortable to access all the information for the medical staff as
    well as person itself. This portal will be very useful in the extreme emergency conditions like
    accidents where the knowing medical history of person becomes a troublesome job for doctors.
    The annoying job of carrying all reports, keeping and maintaining them becomes very easy
    through the portal. It will be accessible easily anywhere and there will be no need to carry heavy
    files and documents while going to hospitals.</p></h2> </div>
